# OpenDwarf

I will look at pull requests or issues on this repository, feel free to share ideas or give suggestions!


Weird issue not being able to delete when typing a MD doc, anyway

[That's because I just started running this project in an exteral text editor, VScode!](https://www.showwcase.com/show/34429/effortless-scripting-in-godot-4-with-visual-studio-code-a-step-by-step-guide)

## Addons

I Just figured out how to get the Git addon for Godot 4.1, I think it's worth adding it to the repo for now. Might be removed in the future for combatibility issues.

I want OpenDwarf to be easily installed on someone's machine, and have them develop
the same as I do. A vanilla Godot experience as possible, I'm not sure I'm even using vscode.
