# OpenDwarf

## [Play on itch.io!](https://josh-hale.itch.io/dfclone)

I will look at pull requests or issues on this repository, feel free to share ideas or give suggestions!

I had a weird issue not being able to delete when typing a Markdown doc, anyway

[That's because I just started running this project in an external text editor, VScode!](https://www.showwcase.com/show/34429/effortless-scripting-in-godot-4-with-visual-studio-code-a-step-by-step-guide)

## Addon Information

I just figured out how to get the Git add-on for Godot 4.1, I think it's worth adding it to the repo for now. It might be removed in the future for compatibility issues.

I want OpenDwarf to be easily installed on someone's machine and have them develop
identically to me. As vanilla a Godot experience as possible, I'm not even using vscode right now.
